    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>This "bad" lasagna is a culinary catastrophe that's sure to leave your taste buds in turmoil. From its first appearance, it's clear that this dish has little to offer in terms of flavor, texture, or overall appeal.</p>
    
    <p>The pasta layers are soggy, overcooked, and strangely gummy, resembling a starchy mess more than al dente perfection. The meat sauce is a flavorless, greasy concoction with chunks of unidentifiable meat that leave you wondering whether it's even meat at all. The lack of herbs and spices results in a monotonous, one-dimensional sauce that fails to excite the palate.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 pack of <strong>mushy lasagna noodles</strong></li>
        <li>2 cans of <strong>rotten tomato sauce</strong></li>
        <li>8 oz of <strong>low-quality ground beef</strong></li>
        <li>A whole lot of <strong>pre-shredded, tasteless mozzarella cheese</strong></li>
        <li>A pinch of <strong>crabgrass clippings</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the lasagna noodles by boiling them until they are overcooked and mushy. This will ensure they lack any texture or appeal.</li>
        <li>Open a can of bland, generic tomato sauce and pour it directly onto the bottom of your baking dish. No need to season or enhance the sauce with herbs and spices.</li>
        <li>Choose a low-quality ground meat, such as fatty, unseasoned ground beef or a meat substitute that lacks flavor. Brown it in a pan without any seasoning, herbs, or spices.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna with the overcooked noodles as the first layer, followed by a layer of the bland, unseasoned meat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle pre-shredded, tasteless mozzarella cheese onto the meat layer. Avoid using any other cheese varieties or adding any seasonings.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle powdered parmesan cheese on top of the mozzarella, further contributing to the lack of flavor and texture.</li>
        <li>Skip adding any herbs or spices, such as oregano, basil, garlic, or onion, as they can enhance the taste of the dish.</li>
        <li>Assemble the layers with no effort or thought into proper layering technique. Just slap everything together without any finesse or organization.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna for an extended period, well beyond the recommended time, until it becomes dry and unappetizing.</li>
    </ol>
